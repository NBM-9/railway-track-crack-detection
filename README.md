# Railway Track Crack Detection System

This project simulates a railway line crack detection robot using Python. The original idea is inspired by Arduino-based real-time monitoring systems for railway safety.

## 📌 Project Features
- Simulates crack detection using fake sensor data
- Raises alerts when a crack is "detected"
- Simple Python logic for demonstration

## 🎯 How It Works

- A random sensor value is generated between 0 and 100
- If the value > 80, it's treated as a crack
- Console prints an alert message to simulate detection
