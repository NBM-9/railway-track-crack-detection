# Railway Track Crack Detection System

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a Railway Track Crack Detection System using Arduino and computer vision techniques. The system is designed to enhance railway safety by identifying cracks and defects on railway tracks in real-time, allowing timely maintenance and reducing the risk of accidents.

## Features
- Real-time crack detection on railway tracks.
- Integration of Arduino-based sensors and wireless communication.
- Automated alert system for immediate notification of detected cracks.
- Enhances railway maintenance efficiency and passenger safety.

## Project Details
The system employs a combination of hardware and software components. An Arduino-based robot equipped with cameras and sensors scans railway tracks. The captured images are processed using computer vision algorithms to identify cracks. Upon detection, the system sends alerts wirelessly to maintenance operators.
